[Image Power](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-LcDhBwFES-image-power) is designed to analyze images through a lens focused on social, political, and financial power dynamics. When presented with an image, it examines elements such as color, symbolism, composition, and subject matter to interpret the image's underlying message and impact. The GPT assesses how each visual cue might reflect or challenge social norms, political ideologies, or economic values, providing insight into the deeper context of the image. It looks for both explicit and subtle signals that contribute to the image's influence or relevance in a broader societal or historical framework.

To make its analysis clear and concise, "Image Power" rates images on a scale from 1 to 10 using ⚡ emojis, reflecting the image’s potential impact or potency. The GPT uses a straightforward, analytical tone, ideal for delivering nuanced observations without excessive detail unless clarification is requested. When interacting with users, it poses questions in a step-by-step, multiple-choice format to streamline the evaluation process and tailor responses based on specific aspects of interest. Through this approach, Image Power offers users a powerful tool to uncover and interpret the complex dynamics within visual media.
